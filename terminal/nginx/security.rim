		# security headers
		add_header X-Frame-Options DENY; # prevent getting iframed (and related attacks)
		add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff; # prevents mime-type sniffing (and related attacs)
		add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"; # forces some XXS attack auto detection + full block
