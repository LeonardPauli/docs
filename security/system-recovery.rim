# System recovery
// TODO

- expect that a system will break
	-> minimize the loss

- regular tests of recovery process
	- test backup system
	- test security breach processes
		- check logs, how to respond, how to prevent further losses etc
	- test uptime losses
		- offline + p2p support + gracefull static webpage + error messages

- backups
	- the rule of three // different locations, different access ways
